> This data could be absolutely transformative for our business - but we can't risk putting it into AI tools.

An agency owner recently told me this. <!-- excerpt -->The company is more profitable than ever but success is pushing them towards burnout. AI offers a remedy to transform operational efficiency, but they're stifled by the fear of security breaches.

Competitors embrace AI whilst they're stuck WhatsApping employees on holiday. Clients need urgent information. Years of client notes sit locked away - too valuable to lose, too risky to use.

When relationships drive your business, the stakes matter. One data leak could cost everything. Only 56% of consumers believe companies can ensure data privacy when implementing AI tools. 

They're right to be skeptical.

Conventional wisdom says: "Sensitive data = Local deployment." But is it really that binary?

In this post, you'll learn the five distinct deployment paths available - each with different trade-offs, requirements, and levels of control. Knowing these options reframes the question from "should we use AI?" to "which approach actually fits our situation?"

### üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Options

Each business balances privacy and productivity differently. The right choice is about alignment, not industry noise. Here's a clear look at your options.

<details>
<summary>üíª Option 1: Lightweight Local (The Quick Fix)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**What?** Deploys AI models on your own device, enabling private, custom chat-based workflows.

**Example:** <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ollama</a> + <a href="https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open WebUI</a> running in Docker on laptops for individual use.

**When?** This works when you need immediate privacy for simple chat based tasks but don't have technical resources.

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $0-650 (per person if hardware upgrade required)
- Ongoing: $0/month
- Time investment: 8-12 hours initial setup and learning

**Difficulty:** Quick start (1-2 weeks)

**Considerations**
- Limited capability that won't scale beyond personal productivity
- Models less capable than cloud based one
- Need decent laptop hardware to run models
- Requires some technical proficiency to run models locally
- Works well for fixing individual productivity rather than business transformation

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>üè† Option 2: Private Infrastructure (On-Premise, Complete Control)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**What:** Run AI models entirely on your own physical hardware, managed and secured by your team, with no external cloud dependencies.

**Example:** <a href="https://vllm.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vLLM</a> running a <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-NeoX</a> LLM model on a local GPU rack sat behind a <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caddy</a> proxy.

**When?** You have high-security requirements, substantial technical expertise, and budget for complete data control.

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $19,000-65,000 (servers, GPUs, networking, installation)
- Ongoing: $2,600-6,500/month (power, cooling, maintenance, staff time)
- Time investment: 2-3 months full deployment

**Difficulty:** Major project (3+ months) + ongoing technical maintenance

**Considerations**
- Expensive upfront hardware investment (GPUs, servers, networking)
- Requires dedicated technical team for setup and ongoing maintenance
- Complex infrastructure management and security responsibilities
- Significant ongoing costs for power, cooling, and updates
- Maximum privacy and control but substantial resource commitment
- Best for organisations where zero external data exposure is non-negotiable

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>‚òÅÔ∏è Option 3: Private Cloud (Dedicated Cloud, Full Control)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**What:** Run AI models on dedicated cloud resources that you control and configure, not shared/public SaaS.

**Example:** Deploy LLMs like Llama 3 using vLLM on dedicated AWS EC2 instances with Inferentia/Trainium chips for scalable, managed inference. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/serving-llms-using-vllm-and-amazon-ec2-instances-with-aws-ai-chips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS deployment guide</a>

**When?** You need control and scalability, but want to avoid on-premise hardware and leverage cloud flexibility.

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $0-2,600 (cloud integration, configuration)
- Ongoing: $650-3,900/month (cloud compute, storage, bandwidth)
- Time investment: 1-3 weeks setup and scaling

**Difficulty:** Medium complexity (1-2 months) + ongoing technical maintenance

**Considerations**
- Lower upfront cost than on-premise, but ongoing cloud spend
- Still requires technical expertise for secure configuration and management
- Data remains under your control, but is hosted offsite
- Easier to scale up or down as needs change
- Vendor lock-in and cloud compliance still need to be managed

<details>
<summary>üá™üá∫ Option 4: EU-Compliant Cloud (The Regulatory Safe Haven)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

EU-hosted providers offering data residency compliance and GDPR-first solutions. This suits EU businesses with strict regulatory requirements.

**Examples:**
- <a href="https://aleph-alpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleph Alpha</a>: A sovereign, transparent EU-based provider focused on data protection, explainability, and compliance for critical industries and the public sector.
- <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI European Data Residency</a>: Mainstream LLMs with new options for processing and storing data exclusively within the EU, helping address GDPR and client data residency requirements.

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $0-2,600 (integration and compliance review)
- Ongoing: $260-2,600/month (depending on usage and provider)
- Time investment: 2-4 weeks setup and compliance verification

**Difficulty:** Medium complexity (1-2 months) + ongoing technical maintenance

**Considerations**
- Best for when regulatory requirements are your primary concern
- Do you need data residency guarantees to satisfy clients or auditors

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Option 5: Sanitised Cloud (The Middle Path)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**What?** Data obfuscation combined with cloud APIs

**Example:** <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N8N</a> jobs running data pipelines to sanitise data before calling cloud based LLM models

**When?** You want cloud performance with enhanced data protection and have the expertise for careful implementation.

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $3,900-10,400 (sanitisation system development)
- Ongoing: $390-1,950/month (cloud costs + monitoring tools)
- Time investment: 4-6 weeks development and testing

**Difficulty:** Medium complexity (1-2 months) + ongoing technical maintenance

**Considerations**
- Requires technical expertise to implement data sanitisation properly
- Need robust obfuscation processes to protect sensitive information
- Ongoing management of privacy controls and monitoring
- More complex than standard cloud but less than full local infrastructure
- Good balance of performance and privacy for technically capable teams
- Success depends on quality of your data protection implementation

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>‚òÅÔ∏è Option 6: Pure Cloud (The Calculated Risk)</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

**What?** Standard cloud APIs with strong contracts and monitoring systems. Choose this when speed of deployment matters more than privacy concerns. Fastest implementation but requires ongoing risk management.

**Example:** Direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini API usage in your workflows

**Cost estimates:**
- Setup: $0-1,300 (integration and monitoring setup)
- Ongoing: $130-1,300/month (API costs based on usage)
- Time investment: 1-2 weeks integration

**Difficulty:** Quick start (1-2 weeks)

**Considerations**
- Fastest time to market with immediate access to cutting-edge capabilities
- Relies on vendor privacy policies and data handling commitments
- Requires ongoing contract negotiation and risk monitoring
- Cost-effective for high-volume usage but potential vendor lock-in
- Suitable when competitive speed outweighs data sovereignty concerns
- Regular compliance audits needed to maintain oversight
- Privacy controls available: opt out of data training, enterprise agreements with enhanced protections, and API-only access to avoid chat history retention

### Combining Approaches
In reality most SMEs don't pick one path. They use different approaches for different data types. Strategic planning happens on local models. Customer analysis runs through sanitised cloud. Content creation uses pure cloud APIs where speed matters more than sovereignty.

Different risks, different tools. Start conservative with sensitive data, experiment freely with operational tasks. The framework scales with your comfort and capability.

### Conclusion

The most expensive option of all is inertia. Your competitive gap widens whilst you deliberate. Choose based on your technical capability, regulatory requirements, and risk tolerance. 

Start small - lightweight local deployment enables experimentation without commitment. Privacy matters, but so does momentum. Make a choice and move forward.
