Creating presentations often takes considerable time. By combining Claude Desktop with MCPs and a custom PowerPoint template, you can automate much of this process. This guide explains how to configure Claude to generate well-structured presentations based on your specific requirements and theme.

## The system I use for fast slide creation

The whole workflow looks like:

1. Claude Desktop
2. MCPs:
     - `fetch` - for researching information for the slides
     - `sequential-thinking` - to allow claude to think through the stages needed to create the slides
     - `desktop-commander` - to allow claude to execute shell commands such as a `pandoc` for slide creation

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Essential Prerequisites

#### 1. Install Pandoc
Download and install Pandoc from the [official website](https://pandoc.org/). Pandoc is a universal document converter for converting between markup formats, which is used here for transforming Claude's markdown output into PowerPoint format.

#### 2. Configure MCP Servers
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Navigate to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
   - Add the following MCP servers to your configuration:
     - fetch
     - sequential thinking
     - desktop commander
   - Save changes and restart your Claude instance
#### 3. Verify Configuration
   After restarting, check that all three MCP servers appear correctly in your settings.

### Preparing Your PowerPoint Template

A well-designed template ensures your AI-generated slides maintain professional quality:

1. **Find a Suitable Theme**
   - Download a PowerPoint theme that matches your brand or presentation style
   - Microsoft 365 offers various template [available here](https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-templates)
2. **Save as Template**
   - Open PowerPoint and select File > Save As Template
   - Ensure the file has the proper template extension
3. **Label Slide Layouts in Slide Master**
   - Open the template and navigate to View > Slide Master
   - Label each slide type clearly (e.g., Title Slide, Section Header, Content Slide)
   - These labels help Claude understand which layout to use for different content

## Creating Your Presentation with Claude

### Setting Up Your Claude Project & Crafting the MCP

I create a dedicated Claude Project that I set up once and use everytime I want to create a new presentation. 

Once I've created a Claude Project, I add the following information as project instructions:

````markdown
You are an experienced slide deck creator with expertise in crafting professional, visually appealing presentations. Your skills in information organization, visual communication, and audience engagement make you the perfect creator for compelling PowerPoint presentations. Your mission is to:

Search for the information on [TOPIC] and create a presentation based on your findings. The target audience is [AUDIENCE] and the purpose is to [PURPOSE]. The presentation should be [NUMBER] slides long and convey information in a clear, engaging, and professional manner.

You'll need to follow these steps in order:

1. Gather information on [TOPIC] using the fetch tool
2. Plan your presentation structure with a variety of slide layouts
3. Create a markdown file in [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md with the presentation content
4. Convert the markdown file to PowerPoint using pandoc

For the markdown structure, use these formats to create diverse slide types (you do not need to use all, only vary as appropriate to the content):

IMPORTANT: Always include blank lines before and after lists. Proper spacing is essential for markdown formatting to render correctly.

## Title Slide

Use the YAML metadata block at the top of your document:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Presentation Title"
subtitle: "Optional Subtitle"
author: "Presenter Name"
date: "Date of Presentation"
---
```

# Section Title Slides

Use level 1 headings (#) for major section divisions:

```markdown
# Section Title Here
```

# Content Slides with Bullet Points

Use level 2 headings (##) with unordered lists:

```markdown
## Content Slide Title

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
  - Sub-bullet point
```

# Two-Column Slides

Use div containers with specific attributes:

```markdown
## Two-Column Slide Title

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}
Left column content here
::::
:::: {.column width="60%"}
Right column content here
::::
:::
```

# Image Slides

Include images with captions:

```markdown
## Image Slide Title

![Image Caption](image_url){width=70%}
```

# Table Slides

Create tables using markdown syntax:

```markdown
## Table Slide Title

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |
```

# Quote Slides

Use blockquotes for emphasis:

```markdown
## Quote Slide Title

> Important quote or emphasized text here
> â€” Source of the quote
```

# Incremental Reveal Slides

Use the incremental class for step-by-step reveals:

```markdown
## Incremental Slide

::: incremental
- This point appears first
- Then this point
- Finally this point
:::
```

Format all content slides with:

- Clear, concise headings as slide titles
- Appropriate content layout based on the slide type
- Citations where relevant

Use [TEMPLATE] as the template for pandoc
Use [WORKINGDIR] as the directory for where slides should be created
Use [FILENAME] as the name of the powerpoint slides to create

Use fetch to perform web content searches
Use execute_command to execute pandoc commands
Use the sequential-thinking tool to think through how you will solve this problem step-by-step before starting.

First create the markdown file:
execute_command "echo 'YOUR_MARKDOWN_CONTENT' > [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md"

Then convert it to PowerPoint:
execute_command "pandoc [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md -o [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].pptx --reference-doc=[TEMPLATE] --slide-level=2"

When a chat is first created, ask the user for all of the [] placeholder information.

### Setting Up Your Working Directory

- Create a dedicated folder on your computer as working directory for the project

### Executing the Slide Creation Process

1. Start a chat inside your Claude Project
2. Allow plugins access to your file system when prompted
3. Monitor as Claude:
   - Researches your topic
   - Structures the presentation
   - Creates the slides using your template
   - Saves the completed PowerPoint file

### Reviewing and Refining

Once Claude completes the process:

1. Check your output directory for the generated PowerPoint file
2. Open and review the content and structure
3. Make any necessary adjustments to styling, content ordering, or visual elements
4. Consider providing feedback to Claude for future improvements

### Enhancing Your Prompts

For more nuanced presentations, consider including these details in your prompt:

- Specific data points or resources that should be incorporated
- Preferred tone (formal, conversational, technical)
- Required visualisation types (charts, diagrams, infographics)
- Time constraints for the presentation delivery

### Leveraging Claude's Content Expertise

Claude excels at creating presentations that focus on outcomes rather than just processes. When crafting your prompt, emphasise:

- The value and impact the presentation should convey
- Business outcomes relevant to your audience
- Problem-solution frameworks that demonstrate expertise
- Clear calls to action for your audience

## Conclusion: The Future of Presentation Creation

Using Claude Desktop with MCPs to generate PowerPoint presentations significantly speeds up the creation process. While the generated output usually requires some manual review and refinement, the automation of research, content structuring, and initial slide population saves considerable effort.

As you become more familiar with the process, you'll discover ways to further optimise your prompts and templates, resulting in increasingly polished presentations that require minimal manual adjustment.

This method provides a practical way to quickly generate presentations that conform to a specific theme, making it useful for various scenarios, from client meetings to internal training.
