When building out a data team, it's important to have the foundations in place. There's little point in hiring expensive Data Science resources if there's not available data to hand. This leads to me first point of who to hire first.

Early on it's important to look for people who are generalists, that's because in the early stages of building out a data team, there will be a diverse set of problems to solve and role boundaries will be blurred.

## Setting up the foundations

### Who to hire first?

Start by hiring a data engineer with a generalist tendancy who can streamline the data that you have. Once they have setup some basic data pipelines, ETL jobs etc.

### Infrastructure

You should build out solid infrastructure before brining in data scientists. Likely you'll need at least one devops engineer to make that happen.


## Scaling the data team

OK, so you've got the foundations in place, you've got your data lake, ETL pipelines.

1. Start with data engineering/platform foundations
    - What?
        - 
2. Add analytics engineers/data analysts focused on business value

    - Data Analytics is in many ways a pre-requisite to more advanced predictive modelling. Having a strong analytics function can provide more immediate business value than data science capabilities. It is a good idea to have this in place to start to instill data driven decision making in the business.

3. Scale both engineering and analytics functions
4. Add specialised data scientists only when foundation is solid
5. Consider more MLOps specialists when models in production reach signficant scale
