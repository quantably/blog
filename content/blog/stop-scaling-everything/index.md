I spoke this week with a company about aspects of the business that could be automated or streamlined. Their live customer sessions are ripe for turning into pre-recorded webinars. Instead, they've decided to keep everything live. They believe in the power of real-time discussion to create shared understanding especially around complex and sometimes messy topics.

It got me thinking about the scaling obsession that exists in our current business climate.

Often the most unique part of a business are the things you choose NOT to scale, even when you could.

Why? Because it showcases the DNA of the company. Constraints reveal values.

Steve Jobs insisted the internal components of Apple devices be beautiful, even though customers would never see them. It made manufacturing harder, but it embodied obsession with perfection in every detail.

The same applies to your business. Sure, you could systematise that discovery process. You could replace those strategy sessions with a standardised framework.

But what if you don't?

I'm all for ruthless automation of repetitive, commoditised work. But also choose what stays bounded and what needs a real-time human touch.

As everyone adopts the same AI tools, everything risks starting to look a bit the same. Smart non-scaling helps preserve what makes you different.
