## My Journey in AI and Data Science
With 15 years in the technology sector and over a decade focused on data science and AI, I've built practical solutions across industries that deliver measurable business impact. My journey from mathematician to AI team leader has taught me many lessons about what makes AI implementations succeed—and why they often fail.

## Lessons That Shape My Approach
### Focus on the Right Data, Not Just More Data
At IBM, I discovered that carefully selected data often outperforms massive datasets for classical ML models. This principle of quality over quantity continues to guide my approach today.

### Start Simple, Measure Everything
At Elsevier, working on recommender systems taught me the power of simplicity. I learned that basic models often outperform complex ones, and that connecting internal metrics to business outcomes like customer satisfaction and retention is essential for success.

### Bridge Research and Product
The coolest technology means nothing if it doesn't become part of a product that delivers value. I've learned to collaborate closely with product teams to ensure technical innovations translate into customer benefits.

### Respect the Data Foundation
At Experian, building transaction classification models reinforced how critical proper data annotation and understanding is to successful AI implementation. Before advanced models, you need solid data foundations.

### Adapt to Constraints
Working with Quin, a med-tech startup, taught me to adapt ML approaches to device limitations and strict regulatory requirements—valuable experience for any company implementing AI in constrained environments.

### Lead with Purpose
At Monolith AI, I've led teams of 4 to 20 people across forward-deployed data science, machine learning engineering, and research functions. This experience has refined my leadership approach: small, focused teams driven by clear metrics and business outcomes consistently outperform larger, less directed efforts.

My approach is straightforward: understand your data, build simple solutions first, measure what matters to your business, and focus relentlessly on customer outcomes. This methodology consistently delivers AI solutions that work in the real world—not just in the lab.
