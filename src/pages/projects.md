## GlucoseInsights

[GlucoseInsights](https://www.glucoseinsights.com/) is an iOS mobile app I developed to help those (like myself) manage their Type 1 Diabetes in and around exercise. It combines workout data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data alongside other metrics to help understand patterns in their data.

## StravaTalk

[StravaTalk](https://github.com/quantably/StravaTalk) is a conversational interface for Strava data that lets you analyse your activities using natural language. Built with the Atomic Agents framework, it transforms simple English questions into database queries and returns human-friendly responses.
