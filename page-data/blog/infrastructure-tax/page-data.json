This in turn leads them to assume that in order to get started with AI they must focus on building data infrastructure first. This kind of endeavor could cost northwards of $2 million dollars before returning a single dollar in ROI.</p>\n<p>There has to be a better way.</p>\n<p>Many organisations are delaying their AI adoption because they think they need specialised data team and significant investment in infrastructure first. They're not stupid, they're just acting on traditional advice that avocates for 'hiring specialised teams' and 'building complex infrastructure' before attaining value.</p>\n<p>There's a time and a place for data lakes but ultimately it comes down to where you sit as a business on the maturity scale. I would argue for many businesses at Level 0, they shouldn't go near a data lake with a 30 foot pole.</p>\n<p>The approach outlined here not only is congruent with the modern day cloud based tooling, but also allows bigger infrastructure investments to be built on small wins therby de-risking the whole process.</p>\n<h2>The Opportunity Cost</h2>\n<p>Traditional advice to (build infra first) made sense when ML was an emerging technology requiring specialised skills. With the advent of no-code, accesible cloud services, pre-trained models the equation has fundamentally changed in favour of those who implement quickly on small projects and scale infrastructure as needed.</p>\n<h2>The Alternative</h2>\n<p>Instead of a large upfront investment, what should companies do?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave data where it is. Most modern AI tools can access data in its native source (easier with MCPs)</li>\n<li>Start small - identify targeted use cases w/ clear ROI potential</li>\n<li>Demonstrate value quickly - focus on well low risk use cases so value comes in weeks not months</li>\n<li>Scale intentionally - build more sophisticated infra as required.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pragmatic AI Maturity Scale: From Zero to Data-Driven</h2>\n<p>Before talking about when different approaches makes sense, it's good to focus on different levels of AI maturity. Knowing where you are as a business can help to know what you need to do next.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level 0: Pre-AI - Businesses operate with entirely manual processes and do not utilise their existing data or any AI.</li>\n<li>Level 1: Individual AI Experimentation - Individuals within the company start using general AI tools ad hoc for personal productivity, with no coordination or business data integration.</li>\n<li>Level 2: Team-Level AI Adoption - Teams begin using AI tools for business efficiencies, developing some shared practices but still relying on public AI with public data.</li>\n<li>Level 3: Connected AI Implementation - AI usage becomes department-wide, connecting to business data, implementing simple automations, and introducing basic governance and ROI tracking.</li>\n<li>Level 4: Integrated AI Solutions - The organisation develops purpose-built AI solutions integrated with core systems, governed by formal policies, and demonstrating measurable business impact.</li>\n<li>Level 5: Transformative AI Deployment - AI is deeply embedded across key business processes, supported by a comprehensive data strategy, and drives new business capabilities and revenue with advanced impact tracking.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The $2 Million AI Mistake Your Company is Making Right Now","date":"May 06, 2025","description":null,"tags":["AI"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/using-mcps-to-generate-presentations-fast/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using Claude to Create Professional PowerPoint Presentations"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"5257903f-25c6-5276-8dd3-535a3c52033e","previousPostId":"631ef93c-4674-5bbf-9adb-25f91b5e1220","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
