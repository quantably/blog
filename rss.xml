&lt;p&gt;With 15 years in the technology sector and over a decade focused on data science and AI, I&apos;ve built practical solutions across industries that deliver measurable business impact. My journey from mathematician to AI team leader has taught me many lessons about what makes AI implementations succeed—and why they often fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons That Shape My Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on the Right Data, Not Just More Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IBM, I discovered that carefully selected data often outperforms massive datasets for classical ML models. This principle of quality over quantity continues to guide my approach today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start Simple, Measure Everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Elsevier, working on recommender systems taught me the power of simplicity. I learned that basic models often outperform complex ones, and that connecting internal metrics to business outcomes like customer satisfaction and retention is essential for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bridge Research and Product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coolest technology means nothing if it doesn&apos;t become part of a product that delivers value. I&apos;ve learned to collaborate closely with product teams to ensure technical innovations translate into customer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Respect the Data Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Experian, building transaction classification models reinforced how critical proper data annotation and understanding is to successful AI implementation. Before advanced models, you need solid data foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adapt to Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Quin, a med-tech startup, taught me to adapt ML approaches to device limitations and strict regulatory requirements—valuable experience for any company implementing AI in constrained environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lead with Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Monolith AI, I&apos;ve led teams of 4 to 20 people across forward-deployed data science, machine learning engineering, and research functions. This experience has refined my leadership approach: small, focused teams driven by clear metrics and business outcomes consistently outperform larger, less directed efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach is straightforward: understand your data, build simple solutions first, measure what matters to your business, and focus relentlessly on customer outcomes. This methodology consistently delivers AI solutions that work in the real world—not just in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Home]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hi, I'm Peter.

By combining Claude Desktop with MCPs and a custom PowerPoint template, you can automate much of this process. This guide explains how to configure Claude to generate well-structured presentations based on your specific requirements and theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The system I use for fast slide creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole workflow looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MCPs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; - for researching information for the slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sequential-thinking&lt;/code&gt; - to allow claude to think through the stages needed to create the slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;desktop-commander&lt;/code&gt; - to allow claude to execute shell commands such as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; for slide creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up Your Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Essential Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Install Pandoc&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install Pandoc from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. Pandoc is a universal document converter for converting between markup formats, which is used here for transforming Claude&apos;s markdown output into PowerPoint format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Configure MCP Servers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Claude Desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following MCP servers to your configuration:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fetch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sequential thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;desktop commander&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save changes and restart your Claude instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Verify Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After restarting, check that all three MCP servers appear correctly in your settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Preparing Your PowerPoint Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-designed template ensures your AI-generated slides maintain professional quality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a Suitable Theme&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download a PowerPoint theme that matches your brand or presentation style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft 365 offers various template &lt;a href=&quot;https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-templates&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save as Template&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open PowerPoint and select File &gt; Save As Template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the file has the proper template extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label Slide Layouts in Slide Master&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the template and navigate to View &gt; Slide Master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label each slide type clearly (e.g., Title Slide, Section Header, Content Slide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These labels help Claude understand which layout to use for different content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating Your Presentation with Claude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting Up Your Claude Project &amp;#x26; Crafting the MCP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create a dedicated Claude Project that I set up once and use everytime I want to create a new presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&apos;ve created a Claude Project, I add the following information as project instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot;&gt;You are an experienced slide deck creator with expertise in crafting professional, visually appealing presentations. Your skills in information organization, visual communication, and audience engagement make you the perfect creator for compelling PowerPoint presentations. Your mission is to:

Search for the information on [TOPIC] and create a presentation based on your findings. The target audience is [AUDIENCE] and the purpose is to [PURPOSE]. The presentation should be [NUMBER] slides long and convey information in a clear, engaging, and professional manner.

You&apos;ll need to follow these steps in order:

&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Gather information on [TOPIC] using the fetch tool
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Plan your presentation structure with a variety of slide layouts
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Create a markdown file in [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md with the presentation content
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt; Convert the markdown file to PowerPoint using pandoc

For the markdown structure, use these formats to create diverse slide types (you do not need to use all, only vary as appropriate to the content):

IMPORTANT: Always include blank lines before and after lists. Proper spacing is essential for markdown formatting to render correctly.

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Title Slide&lt;/span&gt;

Use the YAML metadata block at the top of your document:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token front-matter-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token front-matter yaml language-yaml&quot;&gt;title: &quot;Your Presentation Title&quot;
subtitle: &quot;Optional Subtitle&quot;
author: &quot;Presenter Name&quot;
date: &quot;Date of Presentation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Section Title Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Use level 1 headings (#) for major section divisions:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Section Title Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Content Slides with Bullet Points&lt;/span&gt;

Use level 2 headings (##) with unordered lists:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Content Slide Title&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; First bullet point
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Second bullet point
  &lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Sub-bullet point&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Two-Column Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Use div containers with specific attributes:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Two-Column Slide Title&lt;/span&gt;

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width=&quot;40%&quot;}
Left column content here
::::
:::: {.column width=&quot;60%&quot;}
Right column content here
::::
:::&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Image Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Include images with captions:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Image Slide Title&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;token content&quot;&gt;Image Caption&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&quot;token url&quot;&gt;image_url&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;{width=70%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Table Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Create tables using markdown syntax:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Table Slide Title&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token table&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-header-row&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-header important&quot;&gt; Header 1 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-header important&quot;&gt; Header 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-header important&quot;&gt; Header 3 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data-rows&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Row 1    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Data     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Data     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Row 2    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Data     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token table-data&quot;&gt; Data     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Quote Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Use blockquotes for emphasis:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Quote Slide Title&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token blockquote punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Important quote or emphasized text here
&lt;span class=&quot;token blockquote punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Source of the quote&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Incremental Reveal Slides&lt;/span&gt;

Use the incremental class for step-by-step reveals:

&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code-language&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token code-block language-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Incremental Slide&lt;/span&gt;

::: incremental
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; This point appears first
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Then this point
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Finally this point
:::&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Format all content slides with:

&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Clear, concise headings as slide titles
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Appropriate content layout based on the slide type
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Citations where relevant

Use [TEMPLATE] as the template for pandoc
Use [WORKINGDIR] as the directory for where slides should be created
Use [FILENAME] as the name of the powerpoint slides to create

Use fetch to perform web content searches
Use execute_command to execute pandoc commands
Use the sequential-thinking tool to think through how you will solve this problem step-by-step before starting.

First create the markdown file:
execute_command &quot;echo &apos;YOUR_MARKDOWN_CONTENT&apos; &gt; [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md&quot;

Then convert it to PowerPoint:
execute_command &quot;pandoc [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].md -o [WORKINGDIR]/[FILENAME].pptx --reference-doc=[TEMPLATE] --slide-level=2&quot;

When a chat is first created, ask the user for all of the [] placeholder information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting Up Your Working Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a dedicated folder on your computer as working directory for the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Executing the Slide Creation Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a chat inside your Claude Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow plugins access to your file system when prompted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor as Claude:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researches your topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structures the presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the slides using your template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saves the completed PowerPoint file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reviewing and Refining&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Claude completes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your output directory for the generated PowerPoint file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open and review the content and structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make any necessary adjustments to styling, content ordering, or visual elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider providing feedback to Claude for future improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enhancing Your Prompts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more nuanced presentations, consider including these details in your prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific data points or resources that should be incorporated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred tone (formal, conversational, technical)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required visualisation types (charts, diagrams, infographics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time constraints for the presentation delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leveraging Claude&apos;s Content Expertise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude excels at creating presentations that focus on outcomes rather than just processes. When crafting your prompt, emphasise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value and impact the presentation should convey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business outcomes relevant to your audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solution frameworks that demonstrate expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear calls to action for your audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: The Future of Presentation Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Claude Desktop with MCPs to generate PowerPoint presentations significantly speeds up the creation process. While the generated output usually requires some manual review and refinement, the automation of research, content structuring, and initial slide population saves considerable effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you become more familiar with the process, you&apos;ll discover ways to further optimise your prompts and templates, resulting in increasingly polished presentations that require minimal manual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method provides a practical way to quickly generate presentations that conform to a specific theme, making it useful for various scenarios, from client meetings to internal training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Unspoken Power of Expectation Setting for AI Leaders]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stop blaming the tech or data for failed AI projects.

The real killer? Unmet expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My move into AI management quickly taught me a crucial lesson: expectation setting is a non-negotiable for project success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other areas of tech, the hype around AI creates a dangerously wide expectation gap. AI leaders who are able to navigate this gap are the ones best positioned to turn visions into tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why AI Creates Unprecedented Expectation Challenges?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI, more than other tech fields, is prone to misaligned expectations. Several factors contribute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, its technical complexity. AI can obscure its true capabilities and limitations, especially the significant behind-the-scenes effort required. A common example of this is underestimating the time needed to prepare the data. When working with clients I have this entire phase absent from the project plan, highlighting the gap in understanding this foundational work. Consuming an AI model unfortunately hides the meticulous data groundwork it depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, AI systems are often probabilistic. Unlike traditional deterministic software where 2+2 always equals 4; AI outputs can vary, depend on data distributions, and aren&apos;t always perfect. This probabilistic nature requires a different mindset for evaluation and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the AI development lifecycle differs from traditional software engineering and requires adaptation. AI development is more experimental and iterative, involving less linear paths and a higher potential for setbacks. This uncertainty can clash with expectations set by more predictable software development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I aim to introduce the 3 types of expectations that AI leaders have to navigate most commonly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Three Layers of AI Expectation Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layer 1: Technical Reality Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer represents misalignments on the technical capabilities of an AI model. A key challenge is ensuring stakeholders understand what the technology can realistically achieve, especially its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a particularly potent learning experience for me involved a client baffled by a model&apos;s inability to make accurate predictions on data fundamentally different from its training set. This misunderstanding of the model&apos;s operational boundaries – its inability to reliably extrapolate far beyond the data it learned from – wasn&apos;t just a technical detail; it put the entire project at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, would be people assessing the model based on a few cherry picked examples which ultimately doesn&apos;t reflect the actual efficiacy of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage technical reality expectations effectively, the AI leader must act as both translator and educator. Proactively clarifying a model&apos;s true capabilities and limitations &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; development ensures misunderstandings don&apos;t derail the project later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogies are powerful tools for bridging the understanding gap, especially with non-technical stakeholders. For example, to explain why a model struggles with data vastly different from its training set (poor generalisation), you might compare it to a doctor trained exclusively in the UK needing additional context and training before effectively practicing in parts of Africa where prevalent diseases differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layer 2: Process Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data-first paradigm and iterative development cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Your experience with clients not understanding the sequence of AI development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakeholder involvement as domain experts, not just clients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: How you reframed client involvement in data exploration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational tools to build shared understanding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Your one-pager approach for different aspects of AI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layer 3: Outcome Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining success metrics appropriate for AI capabilities
Tailoring communication to different stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Your approach to executives (business outcomes), technical teams (implementation details), and end users (product focus)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing nature of AI systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Your garden analogy for model maintenance and drift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How mastering expectation setting elevates AI leadership
Practical first steps for improving expectation setting in your organization
Call to action: Invite readers to share their own expectation setting challenges and strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most under discussed aspects of being a good AI leader is the art of expectation setting. Compared to other tech leadership roles, learning the art of expectation setting is hugely important both with internal and external stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Expectation Gap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening hook about the pattern behind AI project failures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief explanation of the unique expectation challenges in AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why this challenge is more acute in AI than other technical domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thesis: Expectation setting is the hidden superpower of successful AI leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the number one reason for AI project failures? I have to be honest, the answer was not what I expected? Rather than insufficient data or a lack of technical skills, the real issue? The expectation gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI introduces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the reason why learning to set expectations is so important is because of the hype-cycle that accompanies the field of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to illustrate the need for expectation setting is to look at examples where the expectations are most awry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An underestimation on the needed to aquire/clean the relevent data required for an ML solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The art of setting expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to delivering AI solutions to customers, the art of expectation setting is about aligning their wants with realworld capabilities without bringing them crashing down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leadership in AI]]></title><description><![CDATA[Are you struggling to communicate the true capabilities and limitations of AI to stakeholders?

Do you find yourself caught between research ambitions and production demands? The reality of leading in the AI space often contrasts sharply with the expectations many bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has navigated these challenges, I&apos;ve discovered that effective leadership in AI requires a unique set of skills beyond technical expertise. Let me share what I&apos;ve learned about setting realistic expectations and balancing competing priorities in this dynamic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing the Expectation-Reality Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &quot;Magic Box&quot; Misconception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the defining challenges of AI leadership is addressing the &quot;magic box&quot; misconception. Too often, stakeholders approach AI with the notion that you can simply feed in data and receive perfect solutions. The reality is far more nuanced, with substantial limitations that need to be communicated effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, two areas consistently require expectation management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Underestimating Data Preparation Timelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of time required for acquiring, curating, and cleaning data before any model training can begin is frequently underestimated. This foundational work often represents the largest phase of any ML project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Value of Benchmarking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining why systematic evaluation is crucial rather than simply pushing out new features can be challenging. Without proper benchmarking, we risk deploying models into production without understanding how they&apos;ll perform—a strategy that rarely ends well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bridging Business Needs and Technical Realities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting in the Middle: A Bidirectional Approach to AI Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most significant breakthroughs as an AI leader came when I discovered the power of bidirectional thinking—approaching problems from both business and technical perspectives simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, I found myself in frustrating meetings trying to get non-technical executives to tell me what precision level or RMSE value we should target for our fraud detection model. I&apos;d present technical slides with ROC curves and confusion matrices, hoping to get a clear target. Their eyes would glaze over, followed by vague responses like &quot;as accurate as possible&quot; or &quot;better than what we have now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning point came during a particularly tense meeting when our CFO finally said, &quot;I don&apos;t know what these numbers mean for our business. I just know fraud is costing us £2.3 million annually.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s when I realised I needed a dual approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From Top-Down Business Needs...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began asking business-focused questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;How much are these anomalies/fraudulent transactions costing you right now?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;What would it be worth to automatically detect these issues in minutes rather than days?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;If we could reduce false positives by half, how would that affect your team&apos;s workload?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;...To Bottom-Up Technical Feasibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, my team worked from the bottom up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the available data to understand its quality and limitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building baseline models to establish what was technically feasible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running experiments to determine realistic performance boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding Value in the Middle Ground&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bidirectional approach created a productive tension. The business perspective pulled us toward ambitious goals, while the technical exploration grounded us in what was achievable with current data and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What proved most valuable was the conversation that happened when these approaches met in the middle. In one instance, our bottom-up exploration revealed we could achieve about 87% precision with our current data—not the 95% stakeholders hoped for. Rather than seeing this as a failure, it sparked a productive discussion about what additional data sources might close that gap or whether 87% precision still delivered enough business value to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve found this meeting-in-the-middle philosophy transforms how teams operate. The top-down business perspective keeps technical work focused on valuable outcomes rather than interesting but irrelevant explorations. Simultaneously, the bottom-up technical assessment prevents unrealistic expectations and identifies specific limitations that need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Balancing Research Exploration and Production Demands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI teams typically operate on a spectrum from pure research to applied engineering. As a leader, you need to establish a thoughtful process for transitioning promising research into production-ready systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key tension here lies in protecting your team&apos;s ability to explore whilst still meeting business objectives. How do you strike that balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining Roles: Research vs. Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my approach, clearly defined roles have proven essential. By separating research-focused positions from machine learning engineering roles, you can move away from that sliding window between the two, transforming it into a more straightforward resource allocation question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tailoring the Balance to Your Organisation&apos;s Stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This balance shifts according to your organisation&apos;s stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue-generating businesses may allocate more resources to longer-term research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-stage companies might focus on pragmatic product features with faster ROI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical element is explicit communication about this split, securing alignment from stakeholders by clearly articulating expected outcomes from research initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thriving Amidst Rapid Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most daunting aspect of AI leadership is the breakneck pace of innovation. New papers, models, and techniques emerge constantly, making it impossible to stay on top of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultivating Continuous Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective response I&apos;ve found is cultivating an environment where continuous learning is the norm. This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocating for experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting aside dedicated time for exploration and learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a culture where pivoting strategies based on new information is acceptable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking the most pragmatic route forward based on emerging signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenging Conventional Wisdom in AI Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Myth #1: Clients Want Cutting-Edge AI (They Just Want Fish)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising realisations I&apos;ve had in my AI career directly contradicts the conventional wisdom in our field: customers rarely care whether you&apos;re using machine learning or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conventional Wisdom:&lt;/strong&gt; Clients want cutting-edge AI solutions that leverage the latest techniques. They want to &quot;learn to fish&quot; with sophisticated models that demonstrate technological prowess.
&lt;strong&gt;Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; Most clients just want fish. They care about business outcomes, not the technological means to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I&apos;d proudly walk into meetings with detailed presentations about our novel neural network architecture or the sophisticated ensemble methods we were employing. I&apos;d explain our feature engineering approach and the elegance of our model selection process. I thought I was impressing clients with our technical sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came a humbling moment during a project review when a client CIO interrupted my technical explanation and said, &quot;Honestly, I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re using machine learning or a room full of people with calculators. I just need to know if this will reduce our operational costs by 30% as promised.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That comment fundamentally shifted my perspective. I had been operating under the flawed assumption that the solution must be machine learning and the problem was whatever issue the client happened to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the relationship should be reversed: the problem is fixed and immutable, while the solution should be flexible and pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led me to a somewhat heretical position in the AI leadership world: sometimes, machine learning is absolutely not the right answer. I&apos;ve had projects where, after initial data exploration, we abandoned complex predictive models in favour of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple rule-based systems that were more explainable and maintainable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deterministic algorithms that performed better than probabilistic approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic statistical methods that achieved 95% of the value with 20% of the complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one particularly memorable case, we replaced a struggling deep learning pipeline with a straightforward decision tree and a set of business rules. The accuracy actually improved, the solution was easier to maintain, and the client was delighted—not disappointed—because their business metrics improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&apos;ve learned is that true AI leadership isn&apos;t about advocating for the most sophisticated solution; it&apos;s about having the wisdom and humility to recognize when simpler approaches are optimal. The best AI leaders I know aren&apos;t those with the most complex models in production—they&apos;re the ones who deliver the most business value, regardless of the technical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before automatically reaching for your deep learning toolkit, ask yourself: Does this problem actually require machine learning, or am I just solving for my own technical interests? Your clients might not care either way, as long as they get their fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Myth #2: Success is the Only Goal (Why You Should Celebrate Failure)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of conventional wisdom I&apos;ve come to reject is the relentless focus on success metrics in AI initiatives. The ubiquitous celebration of achievements—improved accuracy rates, reduced latency, successful deployments—dominates our industry narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conventional Wisdom:&lt;/strong&gt; Success is the ultimate goal. Teams should strive to minimize failure and celebrate wins.
&lt;strong&gt;Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; Quick failures are among your most valuable assets. If learning is your true goal, failure is often more instructive than success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered this counterintuitive truth during a six-month project where everything seemed to go perfectly. We hit every milestone, our model performed brilliantly, and the deployment went smoothly. The team was celebrated, bonuses were distributed, and case studies were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in our retrospective, I realized something troubling: we hadn&apos;t learned much. The smooth execution meant we&apos;d stayed safely within known parameters, avoided risks, and ultimately gained little new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with a project that spectacularly imploded just three weeks after kickoff. Our initial approach hit a fundamental limitation in the data architecture we hadn&apos;t anticipated. The quick failure felt devastating at first—until we realized what a gift it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fast failure taught us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical limitation in our data pipeline architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fundamental misconception about the problem domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A gap in our stakeholder communication process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to pivot to a more promising approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those three weeks of failure, we learned more than in the entire six-month &quot;successful&quot; project. The team that experienced this rapid failure subsequently built our most innovative solution to date, precisely because they were armed with knowledge that couldn&apos;t be gained through success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now deliberately structure AI initiatives to fail fast and often—especially in the early stages. We run multiple parallel experiments with the explicit expectation that most will fail. We&apos;ve even instituted &quot;Failure Friday&quot; sessions where team members share what didn&apos;t work and why, with recognition given to the most instructive failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach requires reframing success itself. If you define success as &quot;the model worked as expected,&quot; you&apos;ll miss the deeper measure: &quot;the team gained valuable knowledge.&quot; When viewed through this lens, a quick failure that eliminates ten potential approaches is far more successful than a working model that teaches nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mindset shift has profound implications for AI leadership. It means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating team performance based on knowledge acquired, not just working models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating psychological safety for teams to report and analyze failures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing initiatives with multiple potential failure points to accelerate learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documenting failures as carefully as successes to build institutional knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective AI leaders I know don&apos;t have the most successful projects—they have the most instructive failures. They&apos;ve built teams that fail quickly, learn deeply, and emerge stronger with each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time a project fails rapidly, don&apos;t commiserate—celebrate. You&apos;ve just gained something far more valuable than a working model. You&apos;ve gained knowledge that will inform every future decision, and you&apos;ve gained it at a fraction of the time and cost it might have taken otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Unsung Hero: Iteration Velocity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Your Team&apos;s Speed of Iteration Trumps Everything Else&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful insight I&apos;ve gained leading AI teams isn&apos;t revolutionary in theory, but is surprisingly undervalued in practice: the velocity of your test-iterate-validate cycle is the single greatest predictor of a team&apos;s impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t just about working faster—it&apos;s about fundamentally rethinking how we measure team effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shifting Focus from Lagging to Leading Indicators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organisations focus on lagging indicators: model accuracy, business KPIs, or production deployments. While important, these metrics tell you about past performance, not future potential. They&apos;re the scoreboard, not the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered this truth when comparing two teams in our organisation with similar expertise, similar resources, and similar project complexity. One consistently delivered more impactful solutions than the other. The difference wasn&apos;t technical brilliance or domain expertise—it was their iteration velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-impact team could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test a hypothesis within hours rather than days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy experimental models to staging environments daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get stakeholder feedback on prototypes weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure real-world impact against metrics within two-week cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their counterparts moved more deliberately: multi-week implementation cycles, monthly deployments, quarterly feedback loops. Both teams eventually reached similar technical outcomes, but the faster team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivered value 3-4x faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explored 5x more potential approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abandoned unproductive paths before significant investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built deeper intuition about what would work through repeated experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve since restructured all our teams around this principle, measuring and optimising for iteration velocity as our primary leading indicator. This meant investment in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust experiment tracking infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated evaluation pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamlined deployment processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid feedback mechanisms with stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimising approval bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results have been transformative. Teams that optimise for iteration speed consistently outperform teams that optimise for perfection. They learn faster, pivot more effectively, and ultimately deliver more impactful solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach challenges the common emphasis on thoughtful, deliberate development. There&apos;s a persistent belief in our field that careful planning and methodical execution lead to better outcomes. My experience suggests the opposite: teams that move quickly and test rigorously—even with imperfect approaches—ultimately build better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practical Steps to Increase Velocity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some practical ways we&apos;ve increased iteration velocity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking projects into 2-3 day experimental cycles rather than multi-week sprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating standardised evaluation harnesses that automatically generate performance metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing &quot;guardrail metrics&quot; that must be maintained while experimenting with improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing lightweight stakeholder demos that can be generated from early-stage models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing &quot;no meeting Wednesdays&quot; dedicated solely to implementation and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful question I now ask when evaluating a team isn&apos;t &quot;How sophisticated is your approach?&quot; but rather &quot;How quickly can you validate whether an idea works?&quot; Teams that can answer &quot;by tomorrow&quot; rather than &quot;next month&quot; are invariably the ones driving the greatest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essential Practices for AI Leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communicating Limitations Effectively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When explaining AI&apos;s limitations to stakeholders, I&apos;ve found success with these approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting the importance of labelled data for supervised learning problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining that machine learning excels at interpolation rather than extrapolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using demos and visual representations to illustrate concepts clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Championing Engineering Excellence and MLOps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between a quick proof of concept and a production-ready, scalable application is vast. As a leader, you must advocate for proper software engineering and MLOps practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means taking seriously the infrastructure needs that support model workflows and avoiding the technical debt that commonly plagues ML systems—whether related to model versioning, experimental tracking, or drift detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Action: Strengthening Your AI Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re leading an AI team or aspiring to do so, start by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopting a bidirectional approach that balances business needs with technical realities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questioning whether ML is actually the right solution for your specific problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a culture that celebrates fast failures as learning opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing relentlessly on increasing your team&apos;s iteration velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing clear processes for transitioning research to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders who thrive in AI aren&apos;t just technically brilliant—they&apos;re exceptional communicators who can set realistic expectations, balance competing priorities, and build adaptable teams in a rapidly evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What steps will you take today to strengthen your AI leadership approach?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beyond Technical Excellence: The Reality of Leading AI Teams]]></title><description><![CDATA[When I first moved from an IC role into managing AI teams, I worried about the standard stuff: How do I run a good 1:1?

How do I delegate effectively? Turns out, while those things matter, they weren&apos;t the real challenges that kept me up at night. The unique aspects of leading in the AI sphere demanded a different kind of learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&apos;ve sat through several leadership trainings, and I&apos;d struggle to recall much from them. My real education in AI leadership has been forged in the fires of trial and error – figuring things out, making mistakes, and observing firsthand what actually moves the needle. This post isn&apos;t about textbook theory; it&apos;s a collection of hard-won principles that guide how I operate today. As they say, success doesn&apos;t teach much, so consider these lessons learned primarily from the mistakes I&apos;ve made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on Outcomes, Not Just Inputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an IC, my focus was on inputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I completed this Jira ticket&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I added this regularisation to this model&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I created a new synthetic dataset for benchmarking&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with seasoned tech leaders revealed a different approach: they focused on &lt;strong&gt;outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;. Their weekly &quot;Progress/Problems/Plan&quot; emails highlighted results, even unsuccessful ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Had 3 final round interviews for head of X, none successful, 2 more lined up next week&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in outcomes offers several benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It aligns with what the business and customers actually care about - this helps guard against busywork disconnected from the actual goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to stay centered and see the results in a packed schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one of the most effective ways to remain outcome oriented is by keeping a weekly log of outcomes as work gets completed. This became invaluable for tracking where my time went and focusing my efforts for the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Speak Everyone&apos;s Language (Not Just Tech)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing senior candidates highlighted a critical skill: tailoring the conversation to the audience. As ICs, we often default to technical jargon, which can alienate other groups. An AI leader must quickly switch between high-level abstraction and low-level details, acting as a bridge between engineers and executives like the CTO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top tips for communicating technical topics more broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be concise:&lt;/strong&gt; Less is usually more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on business impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of &quot;we improved recall by 10%,&quot; say &quot;our new system captures 10% more known cases.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask better questions:&lt;/strong&gt; A lesson stolen from Tim Ferriss, this dramatically improved my communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging the gap between functional groups requires clear, concise, tailored communication. Understanding how to convey the same message effectively to a Data Scientist, Sales Leader, or Product Manager is invaluable. LLMs can be great tools for practicing this reframing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even more crucial in the field of AI where there is a lot of jargon. Practicing translating technical topics into business ones, is a great exercise. Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;High recall but low precision&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our system finds almost all the anomalies, but generates some false alarms that we need to filter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Drowning in Meetings? Own Your Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As teams and companies scale, it&apos;s easy to get overwhelmed by initiatives and meetings. At its peak I&apos;ve found myself doing 25+ hours of synchronous meetings in a week. My perspective shifted dramatically when someone told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s your calendar; you are in charge of it. You can choose what you go to or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple statement made me question if I was just going through the motions. Were too many meetings a sign I hadn&apos;t delegated enough? It forced me to deeply consider my priorities and where my involvement was most impactful. I started encouraging others to take my place in certain meetings and report back. It sounds obvious, but we often assume we need to cover all the bases. Sometimes, dropping the ego and realising others are capable isn&apos;t just okay—it empowers them to level up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Alignment &gt; Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new manager, I often sought consensus. A particularly bad example of this was when trying to agree coding standards for the team. Everyone had different opinions, and consensus was ultimately impossible.
Consensus is rare and often unnecessary. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People need to feel heard:&lt;/strong&gt; Truly heard, not just listened to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The group needs alignment:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to &quot;disagree and commit.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming for universal agreement is futile as teams grow. As a leader, your job is to capture signals and distill them into a decision the team can align around. Achieving alignment is incredibly difficult if people don&apos;t feel heard first, often leading to poor outcomes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Trade-offs, Not Roadblocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech leaders spend significant time creating roadmaps. In early-stage companies, these often don&apos;t extend beyond a 3-6 month timeline. Unexpected work can and will inevitably come to you. My initial reaction was often resistance - calling the new work a &apos;bad idea&apos; or &apos;not strategic.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach, however clear I thought I was, led to being ignored, and initiatives proceeded without my buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised there was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I shifted from resistance to curiosity. What was the requestor trying to achieve? How could I understand their perspective? Assuming positive intent and seeking to understand made the other person feel heard and improved my own grasp of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, recognise the three options for unplanned work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absorb it into the current plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop or adjust planned work to accommodate the new request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t do the new work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options 1 (assuming slack exists) and 3 (potentially shutting down important ideas) are usually poor starting points. I learned to focus on option 2: presenting clear trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, a simple table works best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Impact of New Initiative&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Effect on Workstream 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Effect on Workstream 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Effect on Workstream 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Preparing demo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can still ship, but Feature X delayed to Q+1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unaffected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This converts a &quot;should we/shouldn&apos;t we&quot; debate into a relative prioritisation discussion. Stakeholders feel involved, understand the consequences, and see that you&apos;ve thought through the impacts. This drastically improved cross-functional alignment and clarity around unplanned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Own the Outcome, Not Every Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you take care of our AI company IP?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot; Cue me spending weeks curating technical documents, gathering UI justifications, and liaising with attorneys. I used to equate ownership with end-to-end delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a difference. Ownership means taking accountability for the final outcome (e.g., a patent, a published research paper). It doesn&apos;t mean doing all the work yourself. As a leader, you own the outcome and have the ability and responsibility—to enlist help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuance here is figuring out when you are best placed to do the work itself and when delegating is not the right option. That is a judgement call that you hone over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Let Go to Level Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my hardest challenges for me was letting go, especially of coding. After a decade+ of coding, it felt like an identity crisis to stop doing this. If I wasn&apos;t building stuff, what was I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to stay deep in the technical details while managing is a recipe for burnout. The crucial reframe was to instead focus on what I&apos;m &lt;em&gt;gaining&lt;/em&gt;: broader business perspectives to guide the team, closer collaboration with product to connect algorithms to our UI. Letting go of old responsibilities allows you to step into the new, higher-leverage ones demanded by leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Communicating ML Uncertainy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimating technical work is hard, and applied AI research is even harder because you never know when the next breakthrough will land. But research still needs guidance - that&apos;s a key job for a good leader. While you might not be able to predict the final outcome with certainty, a leader must clearly articulate the hypotheses being tested and what the team has learned, even from experiments that didn&apos;t pan out. The leader&apos;s job is to help the team navigate the uncertain world of AI development without completely abandoning the need for a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways I&apos;ve found to explain how an AI team&apos;s deliverables differ from a standard engineering team&apos;s is to focus on &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; as the desired outcome. It can be just as valuable to have &apos;failures&apos; that tell you what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do, helping to refine understanding and shape the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your Company is One Resignation Away from AI Disaster]]></title><description><![CDATA[Imagine halving your programme development time with AI only to realise the entire operation hinges on a single motivated employee who could walk out the door tomorrow.]]></description><link>https://quantably.co/ai-paradox/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://quantably.co/ai-paradox/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine halving your programme development time with AI only to realise the entire operation hinges on a single motivated employee who could walk out the door tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One corporate training company I spoke to recently faced exactly this dilemma. Their impressive AI success created an unexpected vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their AI-secret wasn&apos;t a complex strategy, but a single curious employee who, through trial and error, figured out how to combine LLMs with their deep industry knowledge building well-crafted prompts and applying them throughout their business. AI was used to streamline everything from client discovery, content creation through to quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds great, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these efficiencies hide a big vulnerability: that their business is one resignation away from AI disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t just hypothetical. The problem became clear during one of the team&apos;s post-training analysis calls. The AI expert would usually generate detailed analysis reports right after a training session - giving clients immediate, actionable feedback to discuss during the call. When their AI specialist was unexpectedly absent, there was no one able to step in and generate the reports. The team didn&apos;t understand how to use the tools, leaving them floundering on the call risking reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario highlights an emerging risk that many businesses adopting AI face. The tool that gives companies a competitive edge can also represent their biggest vulnerability. While everyone rushes to implement AI faster, sustainable implementation is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hidden Vulnerability in Your AI Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats across industries. For smaller companies and non-tech organisations, where formal AI training programmes don&apos;t exist, success increasingly relies on what we might call &quot;AI pioneers&quot; - those who take initiative to explore and implement AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pioneers, often through hours of persistence and experimentation, disrupt established workflows often for the better. The systems they build are often brilliant, but their knowledge remains largely undocumented and unshared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AI success stories are celebrated across industries, the vulnerability they create remains largely undiscussed. Consider these increasingly common scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing teams with sophisticated prompt libraries but no documentation of techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations departments with streamlined AI workflows known only to their creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer service systems built on complex LLM knowledge that lives in a single person&apos;s head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, if the AI pioneer leaves, the team is left scrambling. The competitive edge built on their AI skills disappears overnight. This isn&apos;t just a people problem – it&apos;s a fundamental business risk tied directly to their AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building an AI Knowledge Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI resilience requires distributing knowledge across the organisation. Rather than concentrating expertise in a few individuals, forward-thinking companies are creating knowledge networks that capture these learnings systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations who successfully distribute their AI knowledge and expertise, experience numerous benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher overall productivity and efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased talent retention and knowledge preservation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater resilience to disruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced operational risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transformation shifts AI knowledge from a pyramid structure (with expertise concentrated in single individuals) into a mesh - where knowledge, including the valuable lessons from trial and error are shared, documented, and accessible to everyone who needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Vulnerability into Strength&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following represents a three-step process to transform this AI vulnerability into organisational strength:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Audit &amp;#x26; Document&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a comprehensive map of your AI operations to understand where knowledge currently resides and capture the experimental journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and map high-level workflows including current AI touchpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a company &quot;AI Playbook&quot; that includes a central library of effective prompts, documenting both successful approaches and failed experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record video walkthroughs of common AI tasks, including troubleshooting techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Share Knowledge &amp;#x26; Train&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; Transform siloed expertise into collective knowledge through structured learning and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise bi-weekly &quot;AI Skill Share&quot; sessions where pioneers demonstrate their processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish mentor-mentee pairs for hands-on learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate AI responsibilities among team members to build practical experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Implement &amp;#x26; Maintain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; Build resilience into your AI operations through redundancy and contingency planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure multiple team members are trained to run each critical AI process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop offline alternatives for critical workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish emergency response procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this isn&apos;t a one-time checklist but an ongoing cycle. Regularly revisit each phase to adapt to new tools, evolving processes, and changing team knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building AI Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having AI initiatives dependent on a few key people is a common challenge, but one you can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I help businesses transform fragile AI dependency into robust, organisation-wide capability, addressing challenges such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify hidden risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Uncover exactly where your critical AI knowledge gaps and dependencies lie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a clear roadmap:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a practical, tailored plan to distribute expertise and build shared understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement sustainable practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Embed proven strategies for documentation, training, and ongoing knowledge sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the above sounds like something you could benefit from, feel free to schedule a free call to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

There&apos;s little point in hiring expensive Data Science resources if there&apos;s not available data to hand. This leads to me first point of who to hire first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on it&apos;s important to look for people who are generalists, that&apos;s because in the early stages of building out a data team, there will be a diverse set of problems to solve and role boundaries will be blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up the foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who to hire first?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by hiring a data engineer with a generalist tendancy who can streamline the data that you have. Once they have setup some basic data pipelines, ETL jobs etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should build out solid infrastructure before brining in data scientists. Likely you&apos;ll need at least one devops engineer to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling the data team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so you&apos;ve got the foundations in place, you&apos;ve got your data lake, ETL pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with data engineering/platform foundations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;What?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add analytics engineers/data analysts focused on business value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Analytics is in many ways a pre-requisite to more advanced predictive modelling. Having a strong analytics function can provide more immediate business value than data science capabilities. It is a good idea to have this in place to start to instill data driven decision making in the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scale both engineering and analytics functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add specialised data scientists only when foundation is solid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider more MLOps specialists when models in production reach signficant scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Role Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

But as we advance into the era of AI agents, we&apos;re witnessing a fundamental shift toward probabilistic thinking that&apos;s changing what it means to be a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional software engineering operates in a binary world: good or bad, pass or fail. When 100% of the tests pass, you can ship your product. It&apos;s clean, predictable, and comfortably black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic software, on the other hand, abandons these binary outcomes in favour of statistical efficacy. The questions shift from &quot;Will this work?&quot; to &quot;What&apos;s the likelihood of this working?&quot; This reframing is crucial as we build and deploy increasingly autonomous AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t entirely new territory – we&apos;ve had machine learning systems for years. But with the advent of the agentic movement, probabilistic thinking is becoming less of a specialised skill and more of a fundamental requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complexity and Uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As agents become more autonomous their non-deterministic aspects introduce new challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased variability in outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty in comprehensive testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex security and consistency requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complexities demand engineers to develop new mental models for designing, testing, and monitoring AI-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reality Behind the Hype: Why Coding Skills Still Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is filled with claims that you can &quot;lay off your entire team&quot; or &quot;become a 10x developer&quot; simply by combining tools like Cursor and some MCP servers. While these tools are powerful and impressive, there&apos;s still a substantial gap between flashy proof-of-concept and production-ready system. Not all generated code is correct or useful – you need discernment to evaluate it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced software engineers understand that coding is just one part of the job. In reality, a substantial part of a senior engineer&apos;s role includes looking at systems holistically, anticipating potential failure points, analysing technical debt, aligning activities with product roadmaps, mentoring team members, and understanding how systems behave at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These skills become even more critical when dealing with complex, probabilistic AI systems. The value of software engineering isn&apos;t diminishing – what&apos;s changing is the additional skillset required to effectively leverage AI tools while still putting systems into production that manage the necessary trade-offs between latency, scale, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Right Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question when considering an agent should be: do I actually need one? Not everything requires a probabilistic approach. Sometimes deterministic software is perfectly sufficient – and an &quot;agent&quot; could still be running deterministic software under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adapting to the Agentic Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For engineers who have determined they need to build agent-based systems, several approaches can help navigate the non-deterministic behaviour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace Structured Outputs&lt;/strong&gt; – The goal isn&apos;t to coerce these models to become deterministic – their probabilistic nature is precisely what makes them powerful. Instead, we need to leverage that strength while building reliable systems. Tools like the Instructor library can be a great starting point in creating controllable structured outputs from LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Validating Systems&lt;/strong&gt; – Increasingly, we&apos;ll use AI systems to verify results from other AI components, creating internal validation loops. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/llm_judge&quot;&gt;LLM-as-a-judge&lt;/a&gt; for a practical example of using language models to evaluate other AI outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from Existing Systems that Operate Under Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; – We&apos;re not starting from zero. Reinforcement learning and many machine learning techniques already operate under probabilistic uncertainty. We can and should apply these lessons to agent-based systems. Google&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/pubtools/4156.pdf&quot;&gt;ML Test Score&lt;/a&gt; provides a fantastic checklist to assess production-readiness of ML systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the Right Problems and Metrics&lt;/strong&gt; – Understand the problem you&apos;re solving first, not just input/output results or benchmark scores. Ensure your data and metrics accurately represent real-world conditions. Rather than chasing corner cases, evaluate performance across diverse test distributions to build systems that solve the actual problem, not just optimise for artificial metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hybrid Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future isn&apos;t probabilistic versus deterministic – it&apos;s both. We&apos;ll need all the strengths of traditional software development alongside these new approaches to probabilistic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complementary nature of these paradigms will produce the most powerful results as we build increasingly autonomous and capable systems. Great software engineers will be those who can navigate both worlds effectively, understanding when to apply each approach and how to combine them seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building StravaTalk - A Natural Language Interface for Strava Data]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the rapidly evolving world of AI agents, finding the right framework can be challenging.

After exploring numerous options that often added complexity rather than solving problems, I discovered Atomic Agents - a lightweight, flexible framework that perfectly balances sophistication with simplicity. This weekend project lets me analyze years of Strava workout data through natural language questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a running enthusiast, I&apos;ve accumulated years of workout data in Strava. While the platform offers basic analytics, I wanted the ability to query this treasure trove of information using natural language - asking questions like &quot;What was my longest run last month?&quot; or &quot;Show me my average cycling speed this year&quot; without building complex filters or exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend project is PoC to explore the capabilities of Atomic Agents, but it demonstrates the potential for more sophisticated applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter StravaTalk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pwxn/StravaTalk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;StravaTalk&lt;/a&gt; is a conversational interface that lets me analyse my Strava activities using natural language. Built on the Atomic Agents framework, it transforms English questions into database queries and returns human-friendly responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../assets/images/StravaTalk.gif&quot; alt=&quot;StravaTalk App&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application follows a straightforward workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;: First, I used the Strava API to export my historical workout records to a local SQLite database. This one-time setup provides the foundation for all queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Processing&lt;/strong&gt;: When a user enters a natural language question, it flows through a pipeline of specialised AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application uses a multi-agent architecture with three specialised AI components built with Atomic Agents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Classification Agent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gatekeeper determines if your query can be answered using available Strava data. It analyses the question, identifies what data would be required, and classifies it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL-appropriate (can be answered with available data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not SQL-appropriate (requires data we don&apos;t have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarification needed (ambiguous query)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. SQL Agent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For questions that can be answered, this agent converts natural language into optimised SQL queries. It understands the database schema (activities, segments, etc.) and builds queries that accurately represent the user&apos;s intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Response Agent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This agent transforms raw database results into human-friendly responses. It formats data with appropriate units (converting metres to kilometres, formatting pace correctly), and presents information in an engaging, motivational way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shared Memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful features is the shared memory implementation. All agents access the same conversation context, enabling follow-up questions like &quot;How does that compare to last year?&quot; without repeating context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structured Outputs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Atomic Agents&apos; integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jxnl/instructor&quot;&gt;Instructor&lt;/a&gt;, the entire system works with strongly typed outputs. This reduces hallucinations and ensures data consistency across the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Development Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impressed me most about building with Atomic Agents was how quickly I could go from concept to working prototype. The framework strikes an excellent balance between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production-ready features (robust error handling, performance optimisation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer experience (clean, readable code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility (easy to customise and extend)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the initial version in a single weekend, something that would have taken weeks with many other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StravaTalk demonstrates how modern AI frameworks can transform personal data into conversational insights. While this project focuses on Strava data, the architecture could be applied to any structured dataset. Thanks to frameworks like Atomic Agents, building sophisticated AI applications is becoming increasingly accessible to developers, opening up new possibilities for natural, conversation-driven interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resources for Getting Started with LLMs]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'm late to the party and playing catch up.
